# KnifeHit
A recreation of a famous mobile game.

In this project I've implemented core mechanics of the original game - Rotating log and knives to throw into that log. Also there are apples representing users balance (but with nothing to purchase lol).

UI part shows:
- Current and best score
- Current and best stage
- Current balance
- The remaining knives

Gameplay:
By tapping on the screen Player throws knives into the log. If he manages to succesfully land all the knives into the wood - he moves to the next level. If one knife hits another - Player loses and then can start over.

In the settings User can turn on\off the haptic feedback.

Game stores information about the best result, current balance and Player settings.
